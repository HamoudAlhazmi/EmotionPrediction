# Welcome to the emotion prediction project

In this project, we will build a machine learning model that can extract the human emotions from text

## To do

1- Import libraries<br/>
2- Define models<br/>
3- Load data<br/>
4- Directly influences the model's performance (Pre-processing)<br/>
5- Apply train_test_split to split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets<br/>
6- Apply feature extraction (TfidfVectorizer)<br/>
7- Choose a model to classify the data<br/>
9- Finally we will use area under the curve (AUC) and F1-score to measure modelsâ€™ performance<br/>
