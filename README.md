# Welcome to the emotion prediction project

In this project, we will build a webpage which will have a text box and a button. When the user enters any sentence in the text box and hits the button, there will be a recommendation given to the user based on what he/she wrote. It could be any recommendation, but we might choose articles to recommend for users to read. For example, If the user enters a sentence like “today is a bad day” and hits the button, then there will be a recommendation given to read certain articles that make the person’s mood better. 
In this project, we will be dealing with different areas, a) Web development front-end and back-end, b) Machine learning model, c) Sentiment analysis, d) Recommender system, e) Data collection. 

## To do

Our project will have two main parts: 
1-	Two machine learning models
2-	Recommender system

The first machine learning model will have: positive and negative classes. The second model will have sub-classes and 20newsgroups will be used as the dataset. The second part of the project is a recommender system. It will recommend news articles to the user based on the text. We will be collecting data ourselves by creating a Google form. 

Finally, we will design a webpage using Django which is a high-level Python-based free and open-source web framework.
